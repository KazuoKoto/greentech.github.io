Developed by Whirlpool’s WLabs, it fits into any kitchen, and with a simple push of a button converts food waste into homemade fertilizer.</p> 
                    <p class="flow-text">Zera™ Food Recycler uses a combination of oxygen, moisture, heat and mixing to expedite the decomposition process to break down one week’s worth of food into fertilizer. Unlike traditional composting methods, families are able to use the Zera™ system all year-round, regardless of the weather and can remotely operate the appliance through an easy-to-use app.</p>

                        <p class="flow-text">Plug it in and then throw all your food scraps into the chute. The only things you can't put in it are bones and pits, because they're too tough for the Zera's blades to cut through. From there, just make sure it has a carbon filter installed (this is to reduce odor) and add a plant-based additive to assist in the breakdown process. The additive is made out of coconut husk and baking soda, and it's wrapped in paper so the whole thing should decompose fairly easily. </p><p class="flow-text">Keep putting in food scraps for about a week and, through a combination of oxygen, moisture, heat and an agitator, you'll get a pile of freshly made fertilizer perfect for your lawn or garden.</p>

It provides a quote for you and if you accept, it pays you the cash immediately. The atm also accept chargers, cases and other accessories for recycling, but there is no payout for them.</p> <p class="flow-text">Devices from all carriers are accepted. ecoATM either arranges for reuse or recycling of your former device. Now you can sell back your old cell phone, mp3 player and tablet rather than trow it away. By using this way, you not only will gain some money but you will save the earth too.</p>

                            <p class="flow-text">First you should completely wipe the phone and remove any micro-SD card (if applicable) to protect your data and eliminate any personal information. Secondly, make sure you have the appropriate ID to conduct transactions on an ecoATM. ecoATM "accept most government or US state issued identification cards except for Military IDs, passports (book), passport cards and enhanced driver's licenses.".</p> 
                            <p class="flow-text">ecoATM will accept nonworking devices, but to receive the best price the device has to be in good condition. This means that it powers up and has a functional screen. iPhones should have the "Find My iPhone" feature disabled. You should charge it up beforehand if you can, but the ecoATM provides a USB cable if you aren't able to do so. Put the device into their test station for analysis. It will then scan it and present you with a quote. If you agree, it takes about 3-5 minutes to complete the transaction. Once it is complete you get paid.</p>

                <p class="flow-text">Tesla solar roof is a new technology invented by Tesla, Inc. formerly known as Tesla Motors. Tesla solar glass tile is made up of quartz and it has a quasi-infinite lifetime. It can withstand heavy weights and pressure. Tesla solar roof is using Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) technology. BIPV replaces materials of the building envelope with photovoltaics. This is in contrast with traditional rooftop solar installations, which entails attaching a PV module to a building separately. The goal of BIPV is to integrate installation as part of a construction project, rather than a separate post-construction addition. In theory, this would result in significant savings by reducing labor and installation costs and eliminating the need for separate racking equipment. With BIPV, solar becomes an efficient building material rather than a luxury add-on.</p>
                <p class="flow-text">The new roof will be offered in four designs which is tuscan glass tile, slate glass tile, textured glass tile and smooth glass tile. With the four choices design solar can now be fully integrated and customized to match the texture and appearance of your roof. It can now be thought of as an integration rather than an addition where a homeowner chooses what fits their aesthetic preference.</p>

                        <p class="flow-text">The Tesla solar glass tile will be install just like the normal roof tile. The Tesla Solar Roof will work like any rooftop solar system, connecting to your home’s electric panel through an inverter. You could stop there, but the system is being packaged alongside Tesla’s forthcoming Powerwall 2.0, a battery storage device with a built-in inverter. Combining Solar Roof and Powerwall 2.0, Musk promises, will power an entire home with 100 percent renewable energy.</p>
